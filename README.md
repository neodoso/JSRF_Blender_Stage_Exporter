Blender add-on to export and compile custom JSRF levels

How to configure and use the tools explained here: https://jsrf-inside.blogspot.com/2022/07/creating-levels-for-jsrf-overview.html

In order to compile the custom levels you will also need the JSRF ModTool: https://github.com/neodoso/JSRF_ModTool/releases

Check out the blender scene file "Stage_demo_15.blend" provided as an example of the setup for a level to be exported.
Note: by default the textures are embedded in the .blend file so if you try to export, the compiler won't be able to find the textures
so place the files in provided in this repo "textures\dev\" somewhere on your pc and in order to restore the texture filepaths 
in Blender go to  File > External Files > Find Missing Files and select the folder that has the dev textures.
